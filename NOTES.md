We report updated results of the provided pre-trained model on the auxilliary tasks (Table III):

| |  | 
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| (obj) cls, acc: | 		    0.380 | 
| (obj) pos, err_mean: | 		2.495 | 
| (obj) pos, err_median: | 		1.745 | 
| (obj) pos, err_acc0.5: | 		0.145 | 
| (obj) pos, err_acc1.0: | 		0.304 | 
| (rel) dist, err_mean: |       1.234 | 
| (rel) dist, err_median: | 	0.861 | 
| (rel) dist, err_acc0.5: | 	0.322 | 
| (rel) dist, err_acc1.0: | 	0.557 | 

Note that these scores differ only slightly from the reported scores in the paper and, in particular,  don't impact the conclusion of this experiment.
